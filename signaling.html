	    People talk so slow. And that's probably usefull sometimes, but other times, it makes it impossible to follow a conversation (whether it was in a real life, a movie, a phone call, a book etc.)
            If you <u>really</u> know what you wanna say - CUT TO THE CHASE, FUCKFACE!
            I think it can be (it is) a form of gatekeeping..
            Also, using intentionally obfuscated language is  THE <u>signal</u> that you are A PIECE OF A SHIT AND A FUCKING DEGENERATE.</p>
